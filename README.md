# elm-cacay - DEPRECATED

This repo is deprecated. I moved my website to [github.io](https://github.io).

This is my website built using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/), and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).


### Install:

If you haven't done so yet, install Elm globally:
```
npm install -g elm
```

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```


### Serve locally:
```
npm start
```
* Access website at `http://localhost:8080/`
* Get coding! The entry point file is `src/Main.elm`
* Browser will refresh automatically on any file changes.


### Build & bundle for prod:
```
npm run build
```

* Files are saved into the `/dist` folder
* To check it, open `dist/index.html`
